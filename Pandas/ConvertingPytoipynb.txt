We can convert py files to ipynb by jupytext.
For example:
jupytext --to notebook test.py

We can do this with another library, like: ipynb-py-convert
For example:
ipynb-py-convert test.py test.ipynb

But jupytext is better.

Also we can convert ipynb files to py files.
For example:
ipynb-py-convert test.ipynb test.py
